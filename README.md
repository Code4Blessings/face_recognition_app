This is the project I am most proud of. The front-end was created with React. The backend server was done with Node.js and tested using Postman. It also includes a database made with PostgreSQL. The backend server was committed to another github file <a href="https://github.com/Code4Blessings/smart-brain-api"></a> and the app was published on Heroku <a href="https://robins-smart-brain.herokuapp.com"></a>

Give it a try by registering any random name, email, and password. Once given access, post a URL of an image in the form and click “Detect.”  The app will detect the face in the image.
